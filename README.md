This is the README. This project was created with the sole purpose of a Python project where differential equations, mechanics, and Python all combine into one neat application that emphasises the utility of computers. Anyone is free to use this for any purposes.
This project uses Euler Method for approximating differential equations and compares it to the Small Angle Approximation solution for a simple pendulum with no friction involved. This is done using for loops that iterate based on the previous value to build tiny steps of the solution. All of these values are stored then into an array. Using the values from the array, we can then plot all of the data using MatPlot Lib, so that we can compare the solution using Euler Method and the Approximation.
